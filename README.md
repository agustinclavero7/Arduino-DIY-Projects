This repository stores software for different arduino projects. Some of them were made for usefull every-day or job aplications,
others were request from know people and friends. Lastly some art project or just experimetation.



01\. Interactive obstacle detection System: this one was the final proyect of an Udemy course. It measures and display distance with an ultrasonic sensor.

&nbsp;	Also displays a warning message when getting closer and blocks the program when it´s too close. A leds blink faster if the disntance gets closer.

&nbsp;	It has additional screens that you can switch with an IR remote controller, and functions like luminosity sensing.



02\. Spontaneous Breather: this project was for my job. We had a passive lung simulator and we needed to generate spontaneous breaths. The Arduino controls a servomotor

&nbsp;	with a 3d actuator attached. The servo moves at regular rate that can be changed with a potentiometer or rotary encoder. An Lcd display shows the measured rate

&nbsp;	in bpm (breaths per minute) and the possition of the set rate, wich must be confirmed with a switch. Finally it has a calibration function to set the end 	position of the servo, so it can be attached to the lung simulator properly.
